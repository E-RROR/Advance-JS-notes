## Execution context
- Global context will contain all nested function and executable codes
- Global context provide `this` and `Global object` api
- this === window // true :wink


---

## Lexical Environment
#### Lexical mean like where the code is, like scope

In javascript our lexical scope ( available data + variables where the function was defined ) determines 
our available variables. Not where the function is called (dynamic scope)

---

## Hoisting
#### the process whereby the compiler allocates memory for variable and function declarations prior to execution of the code

Var & functions are hoisted first

---

## Function Invocation (arguments)
#### Function execution context give us `arguments` api

---

## Variable environment
#### Local variables in their execution context

---

## Scope chain
#### allow access of parent variables into local scopes/variable env
