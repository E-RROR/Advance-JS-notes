## Execution context
- Global context will contain all nested function and executable codes
- Global context provide `this` and `Global object` api
- this === window // true :wink

## Lexical Environment
#### Lexical mean like where the code is, like scope

In javascript our lexical scope ( available data + variables where the function was defined ) determines 
our available variables. Not where the function is called (dynamic scope)
